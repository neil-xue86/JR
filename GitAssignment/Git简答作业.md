1.Suppose you had a file, called first.md, and you made a copy of this file, named it 

second.md and made some changes to it. Next, suppose you ran diff -u 

first.md second.md. Here is the content of the original first.md

A 

B 

C 

D 

E 

F

Here is the output of the diff command:

![1704032331869](C:\Users\Q123\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1704032331869.png)

What is the content of second.md?

==A==
==B==
==$==
==C==
==#==
==%==
==E==
==F==



2.(True or False) If you accidentally add a file to the staging area, you can remove it using git reset. For example, if you accidentally add thrid.md, but donâ€™t want it to be committed yet, run git reset thrid.md and the file will be removed from  the staging area, but it will still be in your  working directory.   

==True==

3.(True or False) The commands git reset and git revert can only be used to undo commits in the git repository. 

==False==       ==reset undo adds.==

\4. (True or False) The commands git checkout can be used to roll back to a certain 

commit hash (check the documentation if you are unsure). 

==True==

\5. (True or False) We cannot commit changes in the working directory directly to the 

repo without adding it to the staging index first (read the documentation if you are 

unsure). 

==False==     ==git commit -a -m 'xxxxxxxx'==

\6. (True or False) git log -p and git log will give you the same output. 

==False==    ==git log -p show changes of each commit==

\7. (True or False) git log --oneline and git log --stat will give you 

the same output. 

==False    git log --stat shows file changes.==

\8. (True or False) It is recommended that in most cases we should use git revert 

rather than git reset to undo commits because git revert is safer.

==True==
